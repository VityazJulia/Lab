[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts.
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie.
I love the way you lie.

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like.
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe.
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight.
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight.
High off her love, drunk from her hate.
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate.
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates.
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you!" — "No, you ain't!
Come back!" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again.
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great.
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane.
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed.
I snapped, " Who's that dude? ", I don't even know his name.
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again.
I guess I don't know my own strength.

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts.
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie.
I love the way you lie.
I love the way you lie.

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em.
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em.
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em.
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both.
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane.

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
