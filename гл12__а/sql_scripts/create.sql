Youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you havent heard');

I was wondering if after all these years youd like to meet
To go over everything

But I aint done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
Im in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
Ive forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
Theres such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I mustve called a thousand times
To tell you Im sorry
For everything that Ive done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home');

I dont like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isnt cool, no, I dont like you
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!');
