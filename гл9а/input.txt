What lies ahead?
What lies behind this chain of mountains?
Will we ever know?
Maybe a mire
Maybe an abrupt slope
Which challenges us to climb upwards again?

The light is so bright
It takes our breath away
And we stand numb with speechless awe
The time has stopped
And I see clear
As clear as for the last time

So many years I have spent
Searching for the answers
To the questions unspoken
Now the time has come
The iron cage is broken
I wash my hands of you

Trace in a trace
You are sneaking up
Behind me to find my haven
You'll burst the door open
Triumphantly
To find nobody in
